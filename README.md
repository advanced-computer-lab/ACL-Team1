- 🔭 We’re currently working on **Airline Reservation System**

- 🌱 We’re currently learning **MongoDB , Express , React , Node**

- 👯 We’re looking to collaborate on **Airline Reservation System**

- 🤝 We’re looking for help with **Airline Reservation System**

- 💬 Ask us about **Back-end Implementation , Front-end Implementation**

- 📫 How to reach us **kareemacl2021@gmail.com**


- Description : 
Our Website is a fully functioning Reservation System for booking available flights to any countries across the world.
We used MERN stack for implementing this website because it is required for us to use these tools in our course.
We implemented the back-end with node and express; and implemented the front-end using react and axios with the help of mongoDB for online databases.
We hope our Website to be launched worldwide for any airline company that needs it.

- How to Install : 
To run and install our project you need to have installed Microsoft Visual Studio Code with also installing in its terminal all the neccessary tools like
node, npm, express, etc.
First of all ofcourse you're going to need internet access then to run our project you must open in the visual studio code's directory the folder that named "backend" then type in the command node server.js to
run our server file , then to run our front-end you need to open another terminal and direct it to the "frontend" folder then type in the command
npm start.
This will redirect you directly to your default web and access our website fully.

- How to Use : 
Once you have opened our website your going to be redirected to a home page used by any guest user that shows you only all the available flights you can reserve,
but to reserve you have to sign in with your account , or sign up to make a new account if you don't already have.
As a signed in user you can always edit your profile's first name , last name , e-mail , and passport number can be found by pressing on the profile button at the task bar in the home page of the website.
Then after assuming that you signed in you are going to be granted access to reserve any desired flight.
Each flight has its own details respectively showing you the Ecomony Available Seats , Business Available Seats , 
Arrival Date and Time , Departure Date and Time , From Location , To Location , Seats Price.
You can also search by your own criteria using attributes like the Departure City, Destination City , Departure Date , Arrival Date , 
Departure Time , Arrival Time , Economy Seats , Business Seats.
If you wish to book a certain flight you can press view more info button to redirect you to the reservation page to choose the number of Adults desired seats and the number
of Children desired seats as well as the desired cabin for both . After displaying the summary of the reservation if you wish to proceed with the payment you can choose Pay with Card or cancel the reservation you have made.
If you chose Pay with Card it redirects you to the paying page then confirms you your payment by sending you an email with a summary of you reservation.
You can also view all your current flight bookings from there you could cancel your reservation or edit your reservation;
if you wish to cancel your reservation it will be removed from your reserved flights and also accompanied by a cancellation confirmation email sent to the email linked to the signed in user having the details of the reservation and also the refunded amount.
Also if you wish to edit your reservation you could change the number of seats reserved or the flight number booked or the cabin chosen in reserving this reservation .
After doing this you will also be sent an update email containing the updated reservation summary as well as the refunded amount or the debited amount accordingly.
At the Home page you will have a task bar that contains a home button , profile button , logout button , and My Bookings button . 

>The home button always redirects you back to the homepage.
>The profile button redirects you to the current signed in user showing the user's first name , last name , e-mail , and passport number.
>The logout button logs out the current signed in user redirecting you to the home page as a guest user.
>The My Bookings button redirects you to all the reservations linked to the current signed in user.


This part shows a detailed explanation of how to use our website.

# Getting Started with Create React App`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

To run the project you must open in the visual studio code's directory the folder that is named "backend" then type in the command :
### `node server.js`
To run our server file , then to run our front-end you need to open another terminal and direct it to the "frontend" folder then type in the command :
### `npm start`

This will direct you to the website that is running on localhost at port "3001".
